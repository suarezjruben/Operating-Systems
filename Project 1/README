//pre.c (pre)
The first program "pre.c" reads in a list of U.S. states and their populations (multiples of a million). To be simple, you can use the two-letter state abbreviation to represent each state. We assume there are at most 10 states in the list. Inputs are entered through the keyboard and the outputs are displayed on the screen. The inputs end when an EOF (generated by Ctrl-D) is encountered. The outputs of the program display the states whose populations are above 10 million.
